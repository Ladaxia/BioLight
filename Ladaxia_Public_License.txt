All rights reserved.

This license applies specifically to BioLight Project(Entropy-Based Elite Battery System) and all related code, algorithms, documentation, SDKs, demos, audit tools, and structures
that are officially released as part of the Ladaxia Ecosystem.

BioLight is a passive, renewable, and fully audit-ready entropy engine that collects live raw noise
from physical and digital sources (e.g. screen state, RAM, audio signals, etc.).
Where real inputs are unavailable or intentionally blocked, the system falls back to clearly marked simulated input.
This ensures stable entropy without compromising auditability.

Only the most statistically elite entropy samples are retained through a constant, passive and strict selection, that ensures entropy level to keep growing towards ideal levels of entropy over time.
Whitening, compression, or hash transformation are not required prior to use.

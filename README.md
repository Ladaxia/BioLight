# BioLight v1.4 — Passive Entropy Battery System

**BioLight** is a transparent entropy engine designed to passively accumulate high-quality entropy samples from raw input states.  
It operates without hashing, whitening, or compression, and is engineered to function indefinitely in background — feeding a virtual battery of entropy blocks.

## Key Characteristics

- **Passive-only entropy strategy**  
  BioLight never initiates active probing or synthetic noise.  
  Entropy is collected passively from ongoing system events and naturally occurring variation in volatile input layers.

- **No mandatory post-processing**  
  Entropy blocks are stored in raw form.  
  BioLight does not rely on SHA, XOR, or any other whitening technique.  
  Bitstreams can be exported and analyzed directly.

- **Entropy battery architecture**  
  Incoming raw samples are validated and selectively added to a long-living battery of entropy blocks.  
  This battery grows stronger over time as entropy accumulates.

- **Selective refinement (statistical)**  
  Only samples that surpass a predefined entropy threshold are preserved.  
  This enables passive long-term filtering of low-quality input, producing statistically elite output over time.

- **Input transparency**  
  Inputs include — but are not limited to — screen state, timing jitter, volatile memory, system noise, and RAM feedback.  
  If a fallback is used (e.g. in constrained environments), it is openly documented and traceable.

- **Designed for indefinite runtime**  
  BioLight can operate in the background across days, months, or more —  
  capturing moments of rich input activity and silently rejecting weak input.

## Entropy Performance

- Average raw entropy: **≥ 7.9999 bits per byte**
- No post-hashing applied
- Bitstreams are symmetric and statistically uniform under external analysis
- Entropy can reach cryptographic ideal without compression or manipulation

---

## Conceptual Output (structure)

Each entropy block in the battery includes:
- Timestamp
- Entropy estimation score
- Input source classification
- Raw 32-byte payload

These can be optionally exported (manually or via future extensions).

## Usage Contexts

BioLight is suitable for:
- Cryptographic entropy injection
- Identity seed generation
- Scientific simulation
- Passive entropy benchmarking
